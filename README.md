### Task 1: Array Manipulation
- I Created a function `processArray` that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.

### Task 2: String Formatting
- I Added a function `formatArrayStrings` that takes two arrays: one of strings and one of numbers processed by `processArray`. It modifies each string based on its corresponding number; capitalizing for even numbers and converting to lowercase for odd numbers.

### Task 3: User Profiles
- I Created a function `createUserProfiles` that takes an array of names and an array of modified names from Task 2. It returns an array of objects, each containing `originalName`, `modifiedName`, and an auto-incremented `id`.

### Task 4: README
- This README file contains my student ID and a brief explanation of each task.
